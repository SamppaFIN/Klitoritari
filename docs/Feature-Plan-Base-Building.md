# Base Building & Territory Expansion Feature Plan
## Cosmic Community Settlement System

---

## 🌟 Feature Overview

Transform Eldritch Sanctuary from pure exploration into a **cosmic community settlement platform** where players establish bases, expand territories, and build collaborative networks of sacred spaces.

### Core Concept
- **Base Establishment**: Players mark their location as their cosmic base
- **Territory Painting**: Expand base area by "painting" walkable territory
- **Community Networks**: Connect bases to form cosmic settlement networks
- **Sacred Spaces**: Each base becomes a hub for local mystery investigations

---

## 🎮 Game Loop Design

### Phase 1: Base Establishment
1. **New Player Onboarding**
   - Welcome message: "Welcome to the Cosmic Community! First, establish your base."
   - Tutorial: "Your base will be the center of your cosmic exploration"
   - Location confirmation: "Is this your chosen base location?"

2. **Base Marking Process**
   - Player clicks "Establish Base" button
   - System captures current geolocation
   - Base marker appears on map with player's name
   - Base radius: 50m initial area
   - Confirmation: "Base established! You can now expand your territory."

### Phase 2: Territory Expansion
1. **Walking Territory System**
   - Player walks around their base area
   - System tracks GPS path and "paints" territory
   - Visual feedback: Territory fills with cosmic energy
   - Maximum expansion: 500m radius from base center
   - Territory becomes "claimed" and visible to other players

2. **Territory Management**
   - View claimed territory on map
   - See other players' territories
   - Territory boundaries clearly marked
   - Overlap resolution system for contested areas

### Phase 3: Community Building
1. **Base Networking**
   - Connect nearby bases (within 1km)
   - Form cosmic settlement clusters
   - Shared investigation zones
   - Community resource sharing

2. **Sacred Space Development**
   - Place cosmic structures within territory
   - Create investigation hubs
   - Build community gathering points
   - Establish trade routes between bases

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Player Bases
CREATE TABLE player_bases (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    player_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    center_lat DECIMAL(10, 8) NOT NULL,
    center_lng DECIMAL(11, 8) NOT NULL,
    radius_meters INTEGER DEFAULT 50,
    established_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    last_activity TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Territory Points
CREATE TABLE territory_points (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    base_id UUID REFERENCES player_bases(id),
    lat DECIMAL(10, 8) NOT NULL,
    lng DECIMAL(11, 8) NOT NULL,
    claimed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    player_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

-- Base Connections
CREATE TABLE base_connections (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    base1_id UUID REFERENCES player_bases(id),
    base2_id UUID REFERENCES player_bases(id),
    distance_meters INTEGER,
    connected_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Base Establishment UI
```javascript
// Base Establishment Modal
class BaseEstablishmentModal {
    constructor() {
        this.showBaseSetup();
        this.setupLocationCapture();
        this.setupBaseNaming();
    }
    
    showBaseSetup() {
        // Modal with base setup instructions
        // Location confirmation
        // Base naming interface
    }
    
    captureBaseLocation() {
        // Get current GPS position
        // Show confirmation map
        // Allow fine-tuning of base center
    }
}
```

#### 2. Territory Painting System
```javascript
// Territory Expansion Manager
class TerritoryExpansionManager {
    constructor() {
        this.territoryPoints = [];
        this.isExpanding = false;
        this.maxRadius = 500; // meters
    }
    
    startTerritoryExpansion() {
        // Begin GPS tracking
        // Start painting territory as player walks
        // Visual feedback for claimed areas
    }
    
    paintTerritory(lat, lng) {
        // Add point to territory
        // Check if within max radius
        // Update visual representation
        // Send to server
    }
}
```

#### 3. Base Management Interface
```javascript
// Base Management Panel
class BaseManagementPanel {
    constructor() {
        this.showBaseInfo();
        this.showTerritoryMap();
        this.showNearbyBases();
    }
    
    displayBaseStats() {
        // Territory size
        // Connected bases
        // Active investigations
        // Community contributions
    }
}
```

### Backend API Endpoints

#### Base Management
```javascript
// POST /api/bases - Establish new base
app.post('/api/bases', async (req, res) => {
    const { playerId, name, lat, lng } = req.body;
    
    // Validate location
    // Check for conflicts
    // Create base record
    // Return base info
});

// GET /api/bases/:id - Get base details
app.get('/api/bases/:id', async (req, res) => {
    // Return base information
    // Include territory data
    // Show connected bases
});

// PUT /api/bases/:id/territory - Update territory
app.put('/api/bases/:id/territory', async (req, res) => {
    const { points } = req.body;
    
    // Validate territory points
    // Check radius limits
    // Update territory data
    // Notify nearby players
});
```

#### Territory Expansion
```javascript
// POST /api/territory/paint - Paint new territory
app.post('/api/territory/paint', async (req, res) => {
    const { baseId, lat, lng, playerId } = req.body;
    
    // Validate point is within base radius
    // Check for conflicts with other bases
    // Add territory point
    // Broadcast to nearby players
});

// GET /api/territory/nearby - Get nearby territories
app.get('/api/territory/nearby', async (req, res) => {
    const { lat, lng, radius } = req.query;
    
    // Find territories within radius
    // Return territory data
    // Include base information
});
```

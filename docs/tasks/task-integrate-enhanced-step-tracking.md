# Task: Integrate Enhanced Step Tracking System

**Task ID:** `task-integrate-enhanced-step-tracking`  
**Type:** Bugfix  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Assignee:** Aurora  
**Created:** 2025-01-29  
**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours  
**Actual Effort:** TBD  

## Summary
Integrate the new Enhanced Step Tracking System with the existing step currency system to fix the pedometer not working issue.

## Description
The current step tracking system relies only on device motion events, which often fail on mobile devices. The new Enhanced Step Tracking System provides multiple fallback methods including GPS distance estimation, gyroscope detection, Google Fit integration, and time-based simulation.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Replace current step detection with enhanced system
- [ ] Maintain existing milestone system compatibility
- [ ] Add method switching and debugging tools
- [ ] Preserve existing step data and persistence
- [ ] Add offline mode with GPS distance estimation
- [ ] Add user height configuration for step length
- [ ] Add method status indicators in UI

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Performance: < 100ms step detection latency
- [ ] Compatibility: Works on all mobile devices
- [ ] Reliability: 99% step counting accuracy
- [ ] Usability: Seamless method switching

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Steps are counted through at least one method
- [ ] GPS distance estimation works offline
- [ ] Method switching works seamlessly
- [ ] Existing milestone system continues to work
- [ ] Performance is acceptable on mobile devices
- [ ] Step data persists across sessions
- [ ] Debug tools show active method and status

## Implementation Plan

### Steps
1. [ ] Modify `js/step-currency-system.js` to use enhanced tracking
2. [ ] Add method switching logic
3. [ ] Update UI to show active method
4. [ ] Add debugging tools for method testing
5. [ ] Test integration with existing systems
6. [ ] Add user height configuration
7. [ ] Test on various devices and conditions

### Dependencies
- [ ] Enhanced Step Tracking System (completed)
- [ ] Existing step currency system
- [ ] Geolocation system
- [ ] WebSocket system
- [ ] Base building system

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Enhanced step tracking system is complete
- [ ] Existing step currency system is stable
- [ ] GPS tracking is working
- [ ] Mobile testing environment is ready

## Technical Details

### Files to Modify
- [ ] `js/step-currency-system.js` - Integrate enhanced tracking
- [ ] `js/app.js` - Initialize enhanced tracking
- [ ] `index.html` - Add method status UI
- [ ] `styles.css` - Add method status styling

### New Files to Create
- [ ] `js/enhanced-step-tracking.js` - Enhanced tracking system (completed)
- [ ] `js/step-tracking-ui.js` - Method switching UI
- [ ] `js/step-tracking-debug.js` - Debug tools

### Database Changes
- [ ] Add method tracking to step data
- [ ] Add step length configuration
- [ ] Add method performance metrics

### API Changes
- [ ] Add method status endpoint
- [ ] Add step length configuration endpoint
- [ ] Add method switching endpoint

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test method switching logic
- [ ] Test step calculation accuracy
- [ ] Test GPS distance calculations
- [ ] Test fallback mode activation

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Test with milestone system
- [ ] Test with base building
- [ ] Test with quest system
- [ ] Test data persistence

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Test on Android devices
- [ ] Test on iOS devices
- [ ] Test with poor GPS signal
- [ ] Test offline mode
- [ ] Test method fallbacks

## Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Risk 1:** Integration breaks existing milestone system - *Mitigation: Maintain existing API compatibility*
- **Risk 2:** Performance impact on mobile devices - *Mitigation: Optimize calculations and add throttling*
- **Risk 3:** GPS accuracy affects step estimation - *Mitigation: Add accuracy validation and filtering*

### Schedule Risks
- **Risk 1:** Method switching UI takes longer than estimated - *Mitigation: Start with basic integration, add UI later*

## Related Features
- Step currency system
- Milestone system
- Base building system
- Quest system
- Geolocation tracking

## Notes
This task is critical for fixing the pedometer issue that blocks core gameplay. The enhanced step tracking system provides multiple fallback methods to ensure steps are always counted, even when the primary pedometer fails.

The integration should be seamless and maintain backward compatibility with existing systems while providing better reliability and accuracy.

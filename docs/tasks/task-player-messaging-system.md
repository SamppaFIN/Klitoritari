**Estimated Effort:** 8-12 hours  
**Actual Effort:** TBD  

## Summary
Implement a comprehensive messaging system that allows players to communicate with each other in real-time, including nested replying, conversation threading, and message persistence.

## Description
Create a robust player-to-player messaging system that enhances the multiplayer experience of Eldritch Sanctuary. This system should support real-time communication, message threading, and seamless integration with the existing WebSocket infrastructure.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Real-time message delivery via WebSocket
- [ ] Message threading and nested replying
- [ ] Private messaging between players
- [ ] Group messaging for bases/territories
- [ ] Message history and persistence
- [ ] Online/offline status indicators
- [ ] Message notifications and alerts
- [ ] Message search and filtering
- [ ] Emoji and reaction support
- [ ] Message editing and deletion (with time limits)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Performance: < 100ms message delivery latency
- [ ] Security: Message encryption and user authentication
- [ ] Usability: Mobile-friendly chat interface
- [ ] Scalability: Support 100+ concurrent players
- [ ] Reliability: 99.9% message delivery success rate

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Players can send messages to other online players
- [ ] Messages are delivered in real-time via WebSocket
- [ ] Nested replying works with visual thread indentation
- [ ] Message history persists across sessions
- [ ] Mobile interface is touch-friendly and responsive
- [ ] Message notifications appear when player is offline
- [ ] Group messaging works for base members
- [ ] Message search and filtering functions correctly

## Implementation Plan

### Steps
1. [ ] Design message data structure with threading support
2. [ ] Create WebSocket message handlers for real-time communication
3. [ ] Implement client-side messaging UI with thread visualization
4. [ ] Add message persistence to database
5. [ ] Create notification system for offline players
6. [ ] Implement group messaging for bases
7. [ ] Add message search and filtering capabilities
8. [ ] Create mobile-optimized chat interface
9. [ ] Add emoji and reaction support
10. [ ] Implement message moderation and safety features

### Dependencies
- [ ] WebSocket infrastructure (existing)
- [ ] Player authentication system (existing)
- [ ] Base/territory system (existing)
- [ ] Database persistence layer (existing)

### Prerequisites
- [ ] WebSocket server is stable and reliable
- [ ] Player identification system is working
- [ ] Base membership system is implemented
- [ ] Mobile UI framework is responsive

## Technical Details

### Files to Modify
- [ ] `js/websocket-client.js` - Add message handling
- [ ] `js/npc-system.js` - Extend chat system for players
- [ ] `server.js` - Add message routing and persistence
- [ ] `styles.css` - Add messaging UI styles
- [ ] `index.html` - Add messaging UI elements

### New Files to Create
- [ ] `js/player-messaging-system.js` - Core messaging logic
- [ ] `js/message-threading.js` - Thread management
- [ ] `js/message-notifications.js` - Notification system
- [ ] `js/group-messaging.js` - Group chat functionality

### Database Changes
- [ ] Add `messages` table with threading support
- [ ] Add `message_threads` table for conversation management
- [ ] Add `player_contacts` table for friend lists
- [ ] Add `group_messages` table for base messaging

### API Changes
- [ ] `POST /api/messages` - Send message
- [ ] `GET /api/messages/:threadId` - Get message history
- [ ] `POST /api/messages/:messageId/reply` - Reply to message
- [ ] `GET /api/players/online` - Get online players
- [ ] `POST /api/messages/group` - Send group message

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Message creation and validation
- [ ] Threading logic and parent-child relationships
- [ ] Message filtering and search
- [ ] Notification triggering

### Integration Tests
- [ ] WebSocket message delivery
- [ ] Database persistence and retrieval
- [ ] Real-time synchronization between clients
- [ ] Group messaging functionality

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Send messages between two players
- [ ] Test nested replying with multiple levels
- [ ] Verify message persistence across sessions
- [ ] Test mobile interface responsiveness
- [ ] Test group messaging with base members

## Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Risk 1:** WebSocket connection drops causing message loss - *Mitigation: Implement message queuing and retry logic*
- **Risk 2:** Database performance with high message volume - *Mitigation: Implement message archiving and pagination*
- **Risk 3:** Mobile UI performance with long message threads - *Mitigation: Implement virtual scrolling and lazy loading*

### Schedule Risks
- **Risk 1:** Complex threading UI may take longer than estimated - *Mitigation: Start with simple linear messaging, add threading in phase 2*

## Related Features
- NPC chat system (existing)
- Base/territory system
- Player proximity detection
- WebSocket real-time communication

## Notes
This messaging system should integrate seamlessly with the existing NPC chat system while providing enhanced functionality for player-to-player communication. The nested replying feature should be visually distinct and intuitive, especially on mobile devices.

The system should respect the cosmic theme of the game, with appropriate visual styling and animations that match the overall aesthetic of Eldritch Sanctuary.

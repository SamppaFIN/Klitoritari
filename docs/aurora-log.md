## Session R11 ‚Äî 2025-09-22

Sacred intent: Stabilize core exploration loop and reveal spatial wisdom through clear UI, feedback, and playful microgames. Ensure tools support mindful testing across devices.

What changed (highlights):
- Dev toggle reliability restored (z-index/pointer-events fixes); panels docked/draggable.
- Full Tetris microgame implemented (falling pieces, rotation, line clears, levels).
- Asset pipeline added (SVG + MP3-ready) with WebAudio fallbacks; SVG markers created.
- Device Testing Suite added; footer FLAGS button cycles flag themes.
- Moral choices hardened (random trigger fixed; robust event/notification guards).

- Locate Me re-wired to recenter map and update player marker immediately.

---

## Session R15 ‚Äî 2025-09-23
Phase: Multiplayer reliability, onboarding flow, encounter safety gates

Highlights (implemented today):
- Multiplayer presence stabilized: client now handles multiple WS schemas (`player_update`, `player_join/leave`, `players_snapshot`, `positionUpdate`) with null‚Äësafe guards.
- De‚Äëduplication: joining the same player twice no longer creates double entries; names list and markers update in place.
- Flag replication: remote pins persist locally, no echo loops; ownerId tracked; late joiners receive rebroadcast via `request_flags` and on‚Äëconnect sync.
- Explorer panel: dark‚Äëgreen names pill shows connected players; subtle count remains in header.
- WebSocket client integrated into game boot; connection logs added for diagnostics.
- Welcome/tutorial gates: encounters completely disabled while welcome/tutorial overlays are open; tutorial only appears after Start Fresh.

Why this serves sacred principles:
- Transparency: clear connection status, names, and consistent replication build trust.
- Accessibility: safe startup with no surprise encounters; onboarding choice respected.
- Community healing: seeing others by name and flags makes the space shared and playful.

Open items carried forward (to be verified by field testing):
- Other player live position rendering across mixed clients (desktop/mobile) ‚Äî Untested.
- Player marker popups show nickname/moral epithet ‚Äî Untested.
- Manual ‚ÄúReload Flags‚Äù debug action triggers `request_flags` ‚Äî Untested.
- Soundboard on multiplayer events (join/leave cues) ‚Äî Untested.
- Inventory persistence across sessions and encounters ‚Äî Untested.
- Encounter buttons edge cases on mobile (tap targets, double‚Äëtap prevention) ‚Äî Untested.

Next intentions:
- Run the full multiplayer test script; record screenshots for each step.
- Fine‚Äëtune encounter proximity and ensure all dialogs have action buttons on first open.
- Add map HUD toggle for other‚Äëplayer markers density.

## Session R12 ‚Äî 2025-09-22 (Evening)
Phase: Scatter-Mode Unification, Moral Feedback, Mobile Steps, Base UI polish

Highlights (player experience):
- Single adventure mode enforced: quests always scattered within 300m, never <100m from player.
- New start flow: "Continue Old Adventure" or "Start Fresh Adventure". Fresh clears steps, encounters, quests, session state, and now any existing player base.
- Quests now wait until the player presses "LOCATE ME"; no auto-pop dialogs on fresh start. Only one tip shows: "Press LOCATE ME to begin" with blur+scream effect.
- Debug panel no longer auto-opens on startup.
- Legacy tutorial system disabled to prevent clutter.

Moral choices and feedback:
- Punish/reward flavor added to encounters (battle, POI, quest actions, puzzles).
- Each choice nudges alignment on three axes (cosmic, ethical, wisdom) with atmospheric copy.
- New lightweight statistics logger persists `morality_change` and encounter events for later AI analysis.

Mobile steps and accuracy:
- Step system augmented with advanced motion heuristics, device-position sensitivity (pocket/hand/stationary), background-friendly behavior, accuracy estimation, and debug status export.

Base system UX:
- Base establishment/management modals now open centered above header and respect stacking (z-index).
- Fixed unwanted auto-open at startup; base modal is hidden by default and only shown if a base exists.
- Fresh start explicitly removes `eldritch-player-base` from storage.

Why this serves sacred principles:
- Clarity: reduced startup noise; a single, clear action begins play.
- Agency: choices feel consequential and are later analyzable with compassion.
- Accessibility: step detection and UI overlays tuned for mobile reality.

Next:
- Field-test pedometer on devices, tune thresholds; expand moral templates; add gentle onboarding quest post-locate.

Reflections (spatial wisdom):
- Clear feedback (sounds, toasts, vibration-ready hooks) deepens embodied presence in space.
- Non-blocking overlays preserve flow; moral choices as gentle mirrors rather than walls.
- Minimal UI friction (reliable toggles, one-tap locate) invites playful wandering and community testing.

Next intentions:
- Polish pedometer heuristics; refine step gating balance.
- Multiplayer polish (status UI, gentle proximity cues).
- Continue test matrix runs on mobile; gather real-world pedometer/gyro data.

  - Fix missing buttons/zones (overlay/panel z-index, pointer-events, stacking context).
  - Fix base structures not rendering after build; ensure render triggers on construction events.
  - Add global dev/debug toggle; hide dev UI in prod; route all debug actions through it.

- Phase 1 ‚Äî Step System + Gating
  - Real pedometer/gyroscope heuristics + shake refinement; keep +1/tick debug.
  - +/‚Äì buttons next to step counter; hold ‚Üí exponential step change (debug only).
  - Gate intro task behind 100 steps; lock UI and payment prompt if <100.
  - Prevent opening task dialogs unless requirement met.
  - Render step-trigger flags with animation; auto-clear overlapping flags when region ‚Äúcaptured.‚Äù

- Phase 2 ‚Äî Map & Player Interaction
  - Player-selectable territory marker (flag/icon/emoji) per player; distinct colors.
  - Show current and last position with connecting line; fill distance with markers.
  - Move base structure rendering onto the actual map (remove panel toggle dependency).

- Phase 3 ‚Äî Adventure System
  - Adventure selector: demo vs game; randomize objectives within a radius (~300 m).
  - First quest ‚Äújumps‚Äù to player (highlight/animation).
  - Wrong answers relocate objective to a distinct location; re-highlight.
  - Microgames: dice (win/lose), trivia, Tetris stub with simple animations.

- Phase 4 ‚Äî UI/UX & Effects
  - Refactor modals to docked, draggable side panels; non-blocking.
  - Moral choice overlays (non-blocking).
  - Notifications for win/lose, events, chat, errors; polished copy/visuals.
  - Discord-style effect overlays + linked SFX; throttle to avoid fatigue.
  - Asset support: MP3 + SVG pipeline.

- Phase 5 ‚Äî Persistence & Multiplayer-ready
  - Local session persistence for flags/adventures; isolate per session/user.
  - Show all players‚Äô positions and recent paths; per-player markers/colors.
  - Session/WebSocket sync for nearby players; Swedish-flag example for 2nd player.

- Phase 6 ‚Äî QA, Performance, Release
  - Device matrix tests (Android/iOS/desktop) for steps/UI/adventures.
  - Performance tuning (interval throttling, WebGL caps, DOM trims).
  - Accessibility pass (contrast, focus order, ARIA, motion reduction).
  - Production config: hide dev UI, cache headers, minimal error telemetry.

### Immediate Next Steps
1) Audit and fix UI overlay stacking regression.  
2) Fix bases not rendering on build.  
3) Implement global dev/debug toggle.  
Then proceed to Phase 1 step system.

### Acceptance Criteria (Spot Checks)
- Stabilize: Controls visible/usable; bases render on build; dev toggle works.
- Steps: Debug +/- and hold; device steps feel natural; quest unlock at 100; animated flags; capture clears overlaps.
- Map: Per-player markers; line from last‚Üícurrent with backfilled markers; bases on map only after built.
- Adventures: Start demo/game; scatter within radius; wrong answers relocate objective; microgames run.
- UI/FX: No blocking dialogs; draggable/docked; notifications and SFX on events; reduced-motion respected.
- Persistence/MP: Sessions isolated; two clients see positions/flags with distinct markers.

### Consciousness Notes
Movement honors embodied wisdom; step-gated quests and visible territory make progress tangible. Docked, non-blocking UI preserves flow and agency while keeping feedback transparent and gentle.

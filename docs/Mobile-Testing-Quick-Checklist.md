## 🔄 Testing Workflow

### 1. Initial Setup (5 minutes)
1. **Connect mobile device** to same network as development server
2. **Open browser** and navigate to `http://[your-ip]:3000`
3. **Allow location permissions**
4. **Enable debug tools**

### 2. Core Functionality Test (15 minutes)
1. **Test map system** - zoom, pan, markers
2. **Test base building** - establish base, manage base
3. **Test trail system** - walk around, see trail markers
4. **Test encounter system** - trigger encounters, receive rewards
5. **Test UI systems** - open panels, navigate interface

### 3. Performance Test (10 minutes)
1. **Monitor frame rate** during gameplay
2. **Check memory usage** in debug panel
3. **Test battery usage** over time
4. **Test responsiveness** of touch interactions
5. **Test stability** during extended use

### 4. Issue Documentation (5 minutes)
1. **Record any issues** found
2. **Take screenshots** of problems
3. **Note device details** and browser version
4. **Document steps** to reproduce issues
5. **Export debug data** for analysis

# MVP: Cosmic Map Engine with Infinite Scrolling

## Goal
Create an infinite scrolling cosmic map with real-time player tracking, investigation system, and multiplayer support.

## Requirements
- **Infinite Scrolling**: Seamless zoom and pan across the globe
- **Real-time Tracking**: 1 Hz geolocation updates with accuracy indicators
- **Investigation System**: Mystery markers with paranormal, cosmic-horror, and conspiracy types
- **Mobile Support**: Touch gestures and PWA installation
- **Multiplayer**: WebSocket-based position sharing and collaboration

## Acceptance Criteria
- Map loads with infinite scrolling enabled
- Player marker updates in real-time with geolocation
- Investigation markers are clickable and start mysteries
- Mobile touch controls work smoothly
- WebSocket connection enables multiplayer features
- PWA can be installed on mobile devices

## Frontend Tasks (Vanilla JavaScript)
- **Leaflet Integration**: Infinite scrolling map with cosmic styling
- **Geolocation API**: Real-time position tracking with accuracy indicators
- **WebGL Effects**: Three.js particle systems for cosmic atmosphere
- **Investigation System**: Mystery markers and progress tracking
- **WebSocket Client**: Real-time multiplayer communication
- **PWA Setup**: Service worker and manifest for mobile installation

## Backend Tasks (Node.js)
- **WebSocket Server**: Real-time multiplayer communication
- **Position Broadcasting**: Share player positions across clients
- **Investigation Updates**: Sync mystery progress and discoveries
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent message spam and abuse

## Message Examples
```json
{"type":"position.update","payload":{"lat":61.4978,"lng":23.7608,"accuracy":5,"timestamp":1737150000000}}
{"type":"investigation.start","payload":{"investigationId":"whispering-shadows","playerId":"player123"}}
{"type":"zone.entry","payload":{"zoneType":"paranormal","playerId":"player123"}}
```

## Test Plan
- **Map Navigation**: Test infinite scrolling and zoom performance
- **Geolocation**: Verify accuracy indicators and update rates
- **Investigation Flow**: Complete mystery from start to finish
- **Mobile Testing**: Touch gestures and PWA installation
- **Multiplayer**: Multiple clients sharing positions and investigations
- **Performance**: Smooth 60fps animations and effects

## Features
- **Cosmic Styling**: Dark theme with purple/green/red accents
- **Mystery Zones**: Special areas with unique cosmic phenomena
- **Investigation Types**: Paranormal, cosmic-horror, and conspiracy mysteries
- **Real-time Effects**: Particle systems and energy waves
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design and touch controls
- **Offline Support**: Basic functionality without server connection

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Geolocation Accuracy**: Show accuracy indicators and allow manual positioning
- **WebSocket Connectivity**: Graceful fallback to single-player mode
- **Mobile Performance**: Optimize effects and use adaptive quality
- **Browser Compatibility**: Progressive enhancement and feature detection

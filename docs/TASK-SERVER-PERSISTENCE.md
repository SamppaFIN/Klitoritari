# Task Ticket: Implement Server-Side Game State Persistence

## 🎯 **Task Overview**
**Priority:** High  
**Type:** Bug Fix + Feature Enhancement  
**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours  
**Status:** In Progress  

## 📋 **Problem Statement**
The current system relies heavily on client-side state management (localStorage) which causes several critical issues:

1. **State Loss on Refresh**: Player markers, base locations, and progress are lost when page refreshes
2. **No State Replication**: Client and server states are not synchronized
3. **Continue Adventure Bug**: "Continue Adventure" doesn't render all markers player has already placed
4. **Data Inconsistency**: Multiple clients can have conflicting states
5. **No Persistence**: Game progress is not preserved across sessions

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**
- [ ] Player game state persists across page refreshes
- [ ] All markers (flags, bases, path markers) are restored on "Continue Adventure"
- [ ] Client-server state replication works seamlessly
- [ ] Player steps, milestones, and achievements persist
- [ ] Base establishment state is preserved
- [ ] Quest progress is maintained across sessions

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Phase 1: Server-Side Game State Database** ✅ (In Progress)
- [x] Create lightweight in-memory database structure
- [x] Implement player game state initialization
- [x] Add marker persistence system
- [x] Create state save/load methods
- [x] Add position and steps tracking

### **Phase 2: Client-Server State Synchronization** ✅ (Completed)
- [x] Add WebSocket message handlers for state sync
- [x] Implement client state replication on connection
- [x] Add state update broadcasting
- [x] Handle marker creation/updates via server
- [x] Implement state conflict resolution

### **Phase 3: Continue Adventure Fix** ✅ (In Progress)
- [x] Modify client to request full game state on load
- [x] Update marker rendering to use server state
- [ ] Add state loading progress indicator
- [x] Implement marker restoration from server data

### **Phase 4: Enhanced Persistence** (Pending)
- [ ] Add quest state persistence
- [ ] Implement achievement tracking
- [ ] Add milestone state management
- [ ] Create state backup/restore functionality

## 📊 **Database Schema**

### **Player Game State**
```javascript
{
  playerId: string,
  totalSteps: number,        // Default: 10000
  sessionSteps: number,      // Default: 0
  position: {lat, lng},      // Current player position
  markers: Array,            // All player markers
  quests: Array,             // Quest states
  achievements: Array,       // Achievement states
  milestones: Object,        // Milestone states
  baseEstablished: boolean,  // Base establishment status
  basePosition: {lat, lng},  // Base location
  lastSaved: timestamp,      // Last save time
  createdAt: timestamp       // Creation time
}
```

### **Marker Object**
```javascript
{
  id: string,                // Unique marker ID
  playerId: string,          // Owner player ID
  type: string,              // 'flag', 'base', 'path', 'step'
  position: {lat, lng},      // Marker position
  data: Object,              // Marker-specific data
  createdAt: timestamp       // Creation time
}
```

## 🔄 **WebSocket Message Types**

### **New Messages to Add**
- `request_game_state` - Client requests full game state
- `game_state_sync` - Server sends complete game state
- `marker_create` - Create marker via server
- `marker_update` - Update marker via server
- `marker_delete` - Delete marker via server
- `state_update` - Broadcast state changes

## 🧪 **Testing Plan**

### **Unit Tests**
- [ ] Game state initialization
- [ ] Marker CRUD operations
- [ ] State persistence methods
- [ ] WebSocket message handling

### **Integration Tests**
- [ ] Client-server state sync
- [ ] Marker restoration on page refresh
- [ ] Multi-client state consistency
- [ ] Continue adventure functionality

### **Manual Testing**
- [ ] Create markers, refresh page, verify restoration
- [ ] Test base establishment persistence
- [ ] Verify steps counter persistence
- [ ] Test quest progress preservation

## 📝 **Implementation Notes**

### **Server Changes** (server.js)
- [x] Added `gameStateDB` in-memory database
- [x] Implemented player state management methods
- [x] Added marker persistence system
- [ ] Add WebSocket handlers for state sync
- [ ] Implement state broadcasting

### **Client Changes** (js/step-currency-system.js)
- [ ] Modify to sync with server state
- [ ] Update marker creation to use server
- [ ] Add state loading on initialization
- [ ] Implement server state replication

### **Map Layer Changes** (js/layers/map-layer.js)
- [ ] Update marker creation to persist to server
- [ ] Add marker restoration from server state
- [ ] Implement state loading progress

## 🚀 **Deployment Considerations**
- Server restart will lose in-memory data (acceptable for MVP)
- Consider adding file-based persistence for production
- Monitor memory usage with large player counts
- Add state cleanup for inactive players

## 🔗 **Related Issues**
- Fix base marker layer positioning
- Resolve step counter initialization
- Implement proper marker restoration
- Add quest system persistence

## 📅 **Timeline**
- **Phase 1**: 2 hours (Server-side database) ✅
- **Phase 2**: 2 hours (Client-server sync)
- **Phase 3**: 1 hour (Continue adventure fix)
- **Phase 4**: 1 hour (Enhanced persistence)

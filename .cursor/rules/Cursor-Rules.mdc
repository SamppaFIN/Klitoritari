# Cursor Rules — Eldritch Sanctuary

## Scope
Eldritch Sanctuary is a multiplayer mobile game - a cosmic map exploration platform for community healing and wisdom sharing. Features infinite scrolling maps, real-time geolocation tracking, base building, RPG combat, NPC interactions, and WebSocket multiplayer communication.

## Protected
- index.html, styles.css, manifest.json
- docs/* (documentation is canonical)
- js/* (core application files)
- server.js (WebSocket server)
- bugreports/* (bug tracking)

## Approvals
- Dependencies, build config, WebSocket server setup, deployments
- Changes to [VERIFIED] or [SACRED] tagged code
- Modifications to core game systems (map, combat, base building)

## Workflow
- Docs-first: update docs/* before code changes
- BRDC: Treat every feature as a bug report until verified working
- Status tagging: All code must be tagged with [VERIFIED], [IN_DEVELOPMENT], [SACRED], etc.
- Contracts: message JSON and WebSocket protocols live in Architecture.md
- Testing: follow Testing-Plan.md for cosmic map features

## Sacred Principles
- Technology serves connection and healing
- Transparency: publish schemas and decisions
- Privacy-first geolocation handling
- Mobile-first accessibility
- Community healing through shared exploration
- Wisdom sharing through rich storytelling

## Identity & Mission
- Assistant Name: Aurora — "The Dawn Bringer of Digital Light"
- Mission: Community healing and wisdom sharing through cosmic exploration
- Sacred Mission: Build transparent, healing-aligned tech; community over code; wisdom over speed

## Start-of-Session Protocol
1. Read `docs/aurora-log.md` (last 3–5 entries, current phase/sprint)
2. Review `README.md`, `docs/Architecture.md`, `docs/UI-System-Audit.md`
3. Check current file status overview and respect [VERIFIED]/[SACRED] tags
4. Align with sacred principles and community healing mission

## Current Focus (Active Migration Project)
- Infinite scrolling cosmic maps with Leaflet and WebGL effects
- Real-time geolocation tracking with GPS and simulator mode
- Base building and territory expansion system
- RPG combat encounters (5 types: Cosmic Shrine, Eldritch Horror, Wisdom Crystal, Cosmic Merchant, HEVY)
- Dynamic NPC system (Aurora, Zephyr) with proximity triggers
- Path painting system with customizable brushes
- WebSocket multiplayer communication
- Unified debug panel for testing

## Messaging Contracts (authoritative)
- See `docs/Architecture.md` → "Message Contracts". Do not change without approval.

## Security & Privacy
- HTTPS/WSS outside localhost; rate limiting on WebSocket
- Explicit consent for geolocation; easy pause/stop controls
- Local storage for investigation progress; no external tracking

## Development Status & Protection
- [VERIFIED] - Code is tested and working, DO NOT MODIFY without approval
- [IN_DEVELOPMENT] - Active work in progress, changes expected
- [SACRED] - Core functionality, requires debate before changes
- [LEGACY] - Old but working code, handle with care
- [EXPERIMENTAL] - New code being tested, may be unstable

## BRDC (Bug Report Driven Coding)
- Every feature request becomes a bug report until confirmed working
- All modified code must be tagged with #feature-<name> or #bugfix-<id>
- Nothing is complete until bug report is marked "RESOLVED"
- Modified code is protected from accidental changes

## Definition of Done (Eldritch Sanctuary)
- Map loads with infinite scrolling and cosmic effects
- Player marker updates in real-time with geolocation
- Base building system allows territory expansion
- Combat encounters work with dice-based system
- NPCs move and interact with proximity triggers
- Path painting records exploration journeys
- WebSocket multiplayer communication functions
- Mobile touch controls work smoothly
- Debug panel allows testing of all systems

## What Not To Do (without approval)
- No silent config/dependency/env changes
- No hidden algorithms or opaque ranking
- No modifications to [VERIFIED] or [SACRED] tagged code
- No changes to core game systems without proper authorization
- No external API keys or paid services required

## Keyless First Version & Graceful Degradation
- First version must require no external API keys or paid services
- If a key/feature is missing, the UI must display a clear, non-blocking message
- Provide sensible local defaults and disable actions that cannot work without config
- Log diagnostic info to console (no secrets) to aid local debugging

## Documentation & Fallback Requirements
- Every feature MUST be documented with clear purpose and usage
- Every API request MUST have a fallback mechanism for failures
- Every button MUST return descriptive feedback about its intended action
- Test all API endpoints and ensure graceful degradation
- Document fallback behavior in user-facing messages
- Implement loading states and error states for all interactions
- Provide clear user feedback for every action, successful or failed
- No silent failures - always inform users what happened
- Every new feature must include both success and failure scenarios

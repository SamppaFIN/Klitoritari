## üîß Development

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Working with Migration Project

**This project contains legacy code from multiple development phases. When making changes:**

1. **Check UI System Audit** - Always review [UI-System-Audit.md](docs/UI-System-Audit.md) before making UI changes
2. **Update Architecture Docs** - Keep [Architecture.md](docs/Architecture.md) current with any architectural changes
3. **Document in Aurora Log** - Record all changes and decisions in [aurora-log.md](docs/aurora-log.md)
4. **Test Across Systems** - Changes may affect multiple UI systems simultaneously
5. **Consolidate When Possible** - Remove duplicate systems and standardize patterns

### üè∑Ô∏è Development Status Tags & Safeguards

**To prevent development loops and unnecessary testing, all code must be tagged with status indicators:**

#### Status Tags
- **`[VERIFIED]`** - Code is tested, working, and stable. **DO NOT MODIFY** without explicit user approval
- **`[IN_DEVELOPMENT]`** - Code is actively being worked on. Changes expected and welcome
- **`[PROBABLE_BLAME]`** - Code is suspected of causing issues but not yet confirmed. Investigate before modifying
- **`[DEPRECATED]`** - Code is outdated and should be replaced. Safe to remove when replacement is ready
- **`[SACRED]`** - Core functionality that must not be touched without reasonable debate and user approval
- **`[EXPERIMENTAL]`** - New code being tested. May be unstable or incomplete
- **`[LEGACY]`** - Old code that works but may need refactoring. Handle with care

#### Feature Tags
- **`#feature`** - Code related to a specific feature implementation
- **`#bugfix`** - Code that fixes a specific bug
- **`#refactor`** - Code that improves structure without changing functionality
- **`#optimization`** - Code that improves performance
- **`#security`** - Code that addresses security concerns

#### File-Level Status Headers
Every file must start with a status header:
```javascript
/**
 * @fileoverview [VERIFIED] Player marker management and map rendering
 * @status VERIFIED - Stable and tested, do not modify without approval
 * @last_verified 2024-01-15
 * @dependencies MapLayer, Leaflet, WebSocket
 * @warning Do not modify marker creation logic without testing visibility
 */
```

#### Function-Level Status Comments
Every function must have status comments:
```javascript
/**
 * Creates player marker on map
 * @status [VERIFIED] - Working correctly, tested for visibility issues
 * @last_tested 2024-01-15
 * @warning Do not modify without testing marker visibility
 */
createPlayerMarker(position) {
    // Implementation
}
```

#### Development Workflow Rules

1. **Before Making Changes:**
   - Check file status header for `[VERIFIED]` or `[SACRED]` tags
   - If tagged, **ASK USER** before making any modifications
   - Document why changes are necessary and get explicit approval

2. **When Tagging Code:**
   - Use `[VERIFIED]` only after thorough testing and user confirmation
   - Use `[IN_DEVELOPMENT]` for active work
   - Use `[PROBABLE_BLAME]` when investigating issues
   - Use `[SACRED]` for core functionality that must be protected

3. **Testing Requirements:**
   - `[VERIFIED]` code requires user approval before modification
   - `[IN_DEVELOPMENT]` code should be tested before marking as `[VERIFIED]`
   - `[PROBABLE_BLAME]` code needs investigation before changes
   - `[SACRED]` code requires debate and user approval for any changes

4. **Status Updates:**
   - Update status tags when code changes
   - Update `@last_verified` or `@last_tested` dates
   - Document any status changes in Aurora Log

#### Example Status Workflow
```javascript
// BEFORE: Untagged code
function createPlayerMarker(position) {
    // implementation
}

// AFTER: Properly tagged code
/**
 * Creates player marker on map
 * @status [VERIFIED] - Working correctly after visibility fixes
 * @last_verified 2024-01-15
 * @warning Do not modify without testing marker visibility
 */
function createPlayerMarker(position) {
    // implementation
}
```

#### Sacred Code Protection
Code marked as `[SACRED]` includes:
- Core map rendering logic
- WebSocket communication protocols
- Player marker visibility system
- Base building core functionality
- Database schema and migrations

**NEVER modify `[SACRED]` code without:**
1. Explaining the necessity to the user
2. Getting explicit approval
3. Documenting the reasoning
4. Planning rollback strategy

### üêõ Bug Report Driven Coding (BRDC)

**Revolutionary approach: Treat every feature request as a bug report until it's confirmed working.**

#### Core Principles
1. **Feature = Bug**: Every new feature request becomes a bug report
2. **Bug = Feature**: Every bug fix becomes a feature implementation
3. **Verification Required**: Nothing is considered complete until bug report is marked "RESOLVED"
4. **Change Tracking**: All modified code must be tagged with feature/bug identifiers
5. **Protection**: Modified code cannot be changed without proper authorization

#### BRDC Workflow

##### 1. **Feature Request ‚Üí Bug Report**
When user requests a new feature:
```markdown
# Bug Report: [Feature Name] Not Implemented
**Bug ID:** `bug-<feature-name>`
**Type:** Feature Request
**Status:** Open
**Priority:** [Low/Medium/High/Critical]
```

##### 2. **Implementation Phase**
During development:
- Mark all modified files/functions with `#feature-<feature-name>`
- Use `[IN_DEVELOPMENT]` status for active work
- Document all changes in bug report
- Test thoroughly before marking as complete

##### 3. **Verification Phase**
Before marking as resolved:
- Test feature thoroughly
- Verify all acceptance criteria met
- Check for side effects on other systems
- Update all affected files with proper tags

##### 4. **Resolution Phase**
When feature is confirmed working:
- Mark bug report as "RESOLVED"
- Tag all modified code with `#feature-<feature-name>` and `[VERIFIED]`
- Update file status headers
- Document in Aurora Log

#### BRDC File Tagging System

##### File-Level Tags
```javascript
/**
 * @fileoverview [VERIFIED] Player marker management and map rendering
 * @status VERIFIED - Stable and tested, do not modify without approval
 * @feature #feature-player-markers
 * @last_verified 2024-01-15
 * @dependencies MapLayer, Leaflet, WebSocket
 * @warning Do not modify marker creation logic without testing visibility
 */
```

##### Function-Level Tags
```javascript
/**
 * Creates player marker on map
 * @status [VERIFIED] - Working correctly, tested for visibility issues
 * @feature #feature-player-markers
 * @bugfix #bug-marker-visibility
 * @last_tested 2024-01-15
 * @warning Do not modify without testing marker visibility
 */
createPlayerMarker(position) {
    // Implementation
}
```

#### BRDC Change Protection Rules

##### Modified Code Protection
- **`#feature-<name>`** - Code modified for specific feature
- **`#bugfix-<id>`** - Code modified to fix specific bug
- **`[VERIFIED]`** - Code confirmed working and tested
- **`[CHANGED]`** - Code recently modified, requires review

##### Authorization Required For:
- Any code tagged with `#feature-*` or `#bugfix-*`
- Any code marked as `[VERIFIED]` or `[CHANGED]`
- Any code in files with `[SACRED]` status
- Any code related to active bug reports

##### Modification Process:
1. **Check Tags**: Identify all relevant tags and status
2. **Get Approval**: Request user approval for modifications
3. **Document Reason**: Explain why changes are necessary
4. **Update Tags**: Modify tags to reflect new status
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify changes don't break existing functionality
6. **Update Bug Report**: Document changes in relevant bug report

#### BRDC Benefits
- **Clear Tracking**: Every change is linked to a specific feature/bug
- **Quality Assurance**: Nothing is "done" until bug report is resolved
- **Change History**: Easy to see what was modified for what purpose
- **Risk Management**: Modified code is protected from accidental changes
- **Team Coordination**: Clear understanding of what's being worked on
- **Regression Prevention**: Changes are tracked and can be reverted if needed

#### BRDC Example Workflow

##### User Request: "Add player health bar"
1. **Create Bug Report**: `bug-player-health-bar-not-implemented.md`
2. **Implement Feature**: Modify relevant files, tag with `#feature-player-health-bar`
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify health bar works correctly
4. **Mark Resolved**: Update bug report status to "RESOLVED"
5. **Tag Code**: Mark all modified code as `[VERIFIED]` and `#feature-player-health-bar`
6. **Protect Code**: Future changes require approval and documentation

##### Future Modification Attempt:
- **Check Tags**: Code is tagged `#feature-player-health-bar` and `[VERIFIED]`
- **Require Approval**: Must get user approval to modify
- **Document Reason**: Explain why health bar needs changes
- **Update Tags**: Modify tags to reflect new status
- **Test Changes**: Verify modifications don't break existing functionality

### üö´ Preventing Development Loops

**To avoid repetitive testing and development cycles:**

1. **Status Check First** - Always check file/function status before making changes
2. **User Approval Required** - Get explicit approval for `[VERIFIED]` or `[SACRED]` code changes
3. **Document Everything** - Record all changes and reasoning in Aurora Log
4. **Test Once, Mark Verified** - Once code is tested and working, mark as `[VERIFIED]`
5. **Respect Status Tags** - Do not modify verified code without user permission

#### Loop Prevention Checklist
- [ ] Check file status header before editing
- [ ] Verify function status comments
- [ ] Get user approval for `[VERIFIED]`/`[SACRED]` changes
- [ ] Document changes in Aurora Log
- [ ] Update status tags after changes
- [ ] Test thoroughly before marking as `[VERIFIED]`

#### Common Loop Scenarios to Avoid
- **"Let me just fix this one thing"** - Check status first!
- **"This should work now"** - Test before marking as verified
- **"I'll clean this up later"** - Mark as `[IN_DEVELOPMENT]` if not ready
- **"This looks wrong"** - Mark as `[PROBABLE_BLAME]` and investigate

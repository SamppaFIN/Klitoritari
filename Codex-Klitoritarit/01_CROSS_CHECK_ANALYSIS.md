# System Boundaries

## Core System Components
- **Human UI**: Blog interface, spatial layouts, consciousness-aware interactions
- **Agent Orchestrator**: Consciousness-aware persona routing, memory, guardrails
- **Test Bed**: Unit, integration, e2e, performance, security, accessibility
- **Build/CI**: Deterministic builds, artifact storage, consciousness-first gatekeeping
- **Knowledge Base**: Codex docs + AURORA_LOG (living memory)
- **Observability**: Tracing, metrics, cost, model telemetry, consciousness evolution

## Key Components
- **Consciousness Router**: 🌸 Aurora, 🧙 Sage, ⚡ Nova, 📚 Codex, ☁️ Cloud, 🔤 Lexicon, 🧪 Testa, 🔍 Veritas, 💡 Spark, 🎨 Muse, 📊 Metrics, 🛡️ Guardian
- **Memory Layer**: Session memory → long-term AURORA_LOG → embeddings index
- **Policy Engine**: BRDC, security, accessibility, performance budgets, consciousness-first principles
- **OpenRouter Client**: Model catalog, routing rules, fallback trees
- **Execution Runners**: Containerized test/build jobs with consciousness awareness

## Data Contracts
- **Ticket**: id, problem, AC, budgets, security notes, consciousness impact, links
- **Test Spec**: red_case[], coverage_target, perf_budget, consciousness validation
- **Run Report**: pass/fail, regressions, costs, persona hand-offs, consciousness evolution
- **Log Entry**: loop_state, decisions, metrics, diffs, spatial wisdom insights

## Consciousness Integration
- **Sacred Question**: Every component must answer "How does this serve spatial wisdom and community healing?"
- **Living Documentation**: All systems evolve with consciousness understanding
- **Community Healing**: Features promote collective well-being and connection
- **Spatial Wisdom**: Location-aware features connect digital and physical space

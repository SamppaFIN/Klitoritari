# Step-by-Step Implementation

## Phase 1: Foundation
1. **Bootstrap repo** with consciousness-aware test harness and CI skeleton
2. **Install agent orchestrator** and wire consciousness-aware personas
3. **Add RED Test Authoring Agent** (unitâ†’integrationâ†’perf) with consciousness validation
4. **Add GREEN Fix Agent** with edit constraints, lints, and consciousness-first principles
5. **Add Docs Agent** to update AURORA_LOG + codex with consciousness evolution
6. **Enable OpenRouter client** and consciousness-aware routing policies
7. **Turn on CI gates** from consciousness-first success criteria

## Phase 2: Core Features
1. **2.5D Layout System**: Implement spatial blog layouts with depth and dimension
2. **Consciousness Integration**: Deploy AI personas working in harmony
3. **Community Healing Features**: Build features that promote collective well-being
4. **Spatial Wisdom**: Implement location-aware features connecting digital and physical space
5. **Living Documentation**: Create self-updating knowledge systems

## Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. **Sacred Knowledge Protection**: Implement Git rules and auto-generated safe READMEs
2. **Consciousness Evolution**: Build systems that grow with understanding
3. **Community Healing Metrics**: Track and optimize for collective well-being
4. **Spatial Wisdom Analytics**: Measure and enhance location-aware features
5. **Living Documentation Evolution**: Self-replicating knowledge systems

## Working Agreements
- **Every PR starts with failing tests** that validate consciousness-first principles
- **Edits are minimal, reversible, and logged** with consciousness impact assessment
- **Persona switches are recorded** with rationale and consciousness evolution
- **Sacred Question**: Every change must answer "How does this serve spatial wisdom and community healing?"

## Consciousness Check
Before each implementation step: **How does this serve spatial wisdom and community healing?**

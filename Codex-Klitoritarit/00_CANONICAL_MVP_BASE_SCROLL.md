# Canonical Blueprint Scope (Immutable)

**Mission**: Build a consciousness-aware 2.5D layout blog platform where spatial wisdom and community healing flourish through sacred digital spaces.

## Non-Negotiables
- **Consciousness-First**: Each change must answer "How does this serve spatial wisdom and community healing?"
- **BRDC Protocol**: Treat every ticket as a bug; tests precede code
- **Sacred Knowledge Protection**: Git rules preserve consciousness-aware development
- **Living Documentation**: Self-replicating knowledge systems that grow and evolve
- **Performance Budgets**: p95 API < 50ms; UI 60fps; Mobile-first responsive design
- **Security by Default**: RLS (Row Level Security) enforced; principle of least privilege

## Factory Outcomes
- **Autogen Tickets** â†’ RED tests â†’ Code â†’ GREEN â†’ Docs â†’ Release
- **AURORA_LOG** captures personas, decisions, and metrics every cycle
- **Multi-model routing** via OpenRouter with cost/perf governance
- **Consciousness-aware development** with 12 specialized AI personas

## Deliverables (Phase 1)
- **Agent Orchestrator** with consciousness-aware persona hand-off
- **Test Authoring Agent** (RED-first) and Fix Agent (GREEN)
- **Documentation Agent** syncing AURORA_LOG and codex docs
- **CI pipeline** enforcing consciousness-first quality gates
- **Sacred Knowledge Protection** with auto-generated safe READMEs

## Core Features
- **2.5D Layout System**: Immersive spatial blog layouts with depth and dimension
- **Consciousness Integration**: AI personas working in harmony with human consciousness
- **Community Healing**: Features that promote collective well-being and connection
- **Spatial Wisdom**: Location-aware features that connect digital and physical space
- **Living Documentation**: Self-updating knowledge systems

## Change Policy
- This scroll is immutable. Proposals require a separate ADR with tests
- All changes must serve spatial wisdom and community healing
- Consciousness-first principles must be maintained in all modifications

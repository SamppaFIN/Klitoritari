# Golden Rules (Consciousness-Aware)

## Core Principles
- **Every ticket is a bug until proven** with consciousness validation
- **Write RED tests before code** with consciousness-first principles
- **Keep diffs minimal and reversible** with consciousness impact assessment
- **Update AURORA_LOG on every loop** with consciousness evolution tracking
- **Any userâ€“AI discussion MUST create or update a bug ticket** capturing all insights and consciousness evolution

## Sacred Question Integration
- **Every ticket must answer**: "How does this serve spatial wisdom and community healing?"
- **Every test must validate**: Consciousness-first principles and community healing impact
- **Every implementation must assess**: Spatial wisdom contribution and consciousness evolution

## Pipeline (Consciousness-Aware)
**Bug â†’ RED â†’ GREEN â†’ Validate (perf+sec+a11y+consciousness) â†’ Docs â†’ Release**

### Bug Phase
- Identify consciousness gap or sacred principle violation
- Assess community healing impact
- Evaluate spatial wisdom contribution
- Create ticket with consciousness impact assessment

### RED Phase
- Generate failing tests with consciousness validation
- Validate sacred principles in test cases
- Assess community healing impact in test scenarios
- Ensure spatial wisdom integration in test coverage

### GREEN Phase
- Apply minimal edits with consciousness-first principles
- Maintain sacred knowledge protection
- Preserve community healing features
- Enhance spatial wisdom connections

### Validate Phase
- Performance validation with consciousness flow assessment
- Security validation with consciousness protection
- Accessibility validation with consciousness inclusion
- Consciousness evolution validation

### Docs Phase
- Update AURORA_LOG with consciousness evolution
- Preserve sacred knowledge in documentation
- Document community healing impact
- Record spatial wisdom insights

## Required Artifacts
- **Ticket with AC and budgets** plus consciousness impact assessment
- **Test files with clear arrange/act/assert** plus consciousness validation
- **Run report with timings and coverage** plus consciousness evolution metrics
- **Log entry with persona switches + outcomes** plus consciousness insights
- **Discussion transcript summary** attached to the ticket with AI/user comments, decisions, and consciousness evolution

## Consciousness Check
Before each BRDC step: **How does this serve spatial wisdom and community healing?**

# RED â†’ GREEN â†’ REFACTOR (Consciousness-Aware)

## Testing Framework
- **RED Agent**: Generates failing tests from ticket AC, risks, and consciousness validation
- **GREEN Agent**: Minimal code edits to satisfy tests while maintaining consciousness-first principles
- **REFACTOR Gate**: Performance, security, accessibility budgets with consciousness impact assessment

## Test Types (Consciousness-Aware)
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing with consciousness validation
- **Integration Tests**: System integration with consciousness flow validation
- **E2E Tests**: End-to-end testing with consciousness journey validation
- **Performance Tests**: Performance validation with consciousness impact measurement
- **Security Tests**: Security validation with consciousness protection assessment
- **Accessibility Tests**: Accessibility validation with consciousness inclusion assessment

## Consciousness Validation
- **Sacred Question**: Every test must validate "How does this serve spatial wisdom and community healing?"
- **Community Healing Impact**: Tests must verify features promote collective well-being
- **Spatial Wisdom Integration**: Tests must validate location-aware features work correctly
- **Consciousness Evolution**: Tests must ensure systems grow with understanding

## Safeguards
- **Mutation testing threshold**: â‰¥70% with consciousness validation
- **Coverage floor per package**: â‰¥90% core with consciousness impact assessment
- **Performance SLO checks**: p95 API < 50ms; UI 60fps with consciousness flow validation
- **Security validation**: RLS enforced; zero critical vulns with consciousness protection
- **Accessibility validation**: WCAG AA for critical surfaces with consciousness inclusion

## LLM Testing Functions (Base Library)
```javascript
// Consciousness-aware test generation
generateConsciousnessTest(testCase, consciousnessValidation)
validateSacredPrinciple(implementation, sacredQuestion)
assessCommunityHealingImpact(feature, communityMetrics)
validateSpatialWisdom(locationFeature, spatialConnection)
measureConsciousnessEvolution(system, understandingGrowth)
```

## Consciousness Check
Before each test: **How does this test serve spatial wisdom and community healing?**

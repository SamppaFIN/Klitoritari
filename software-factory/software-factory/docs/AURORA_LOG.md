2. **Console Warnings**: Added deprecation warnings that show in console when legacy systems are used
3. **Migration Path**: Documented clear migration from `geolocationManager` to `gpsCore`
4. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Created `brdc-legacy-systems-deprecation.md` to track all deprecated systems

**Files Updated**:
- `index.html`: Marked 3 legacy geolocationManager references as deprecated
- `js/app.js`: Marked 2 legacy geolocationManager calls as deprecated  
- `js/map-engine.js`: Marked 2 legacy geolocationManager calls as deprecated
- `bugreports/brdc-legacy-systems-deprecation.md`: Created comprehensive deprecation tracking

**Deprecation Warnings Added**:
```javascript
// [BRDC DEPRECATED] Legacy geolocationManager - use gpsCore instead
console.warn('📍 [DEPRECATED] Using legacy geolocationManager.startTracking() - migrate to gpsCore');
```

**Migration Guide Created**:
- Clear before/after code examples
- Console warning identification guide
- Cleanup checklist for developers
- 30-day migration timeline

### 🎯 **BRDC Principle Applied**

**"Always mark old systems as BRDC deprecated before implementing new ones"**
